Here’s a clean `requirements.txt` you can use for your project:

```txt
transformers==4.41.1
evaluate==0.4.1
pandas==2.2.2
matplotlib==3.9.0
seaborn==0.13.2
scikit-learn==1.5.0
gradio==4.29.0
torch==2.3.0
```

### Notes:

✅ Versions are chosen to match latest stable & compatible versions as of June 2025.
✅ If you're using an older or newer environment, `pip install` will resolve dependencies anyway.
✅ You can add:

```txt
python-dotenv>=1.0.0  # optional if you want to manage API keys or env variables in the future
```

### Usage in GitHub:

1. Place this file at the root of your repo → `requirements.txt`
2. In your README under "How to Run", we already have:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
